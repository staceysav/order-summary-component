## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap CSS Grid


I decided to make this challenge using Bootstrap. 
The order summary component was created with the Card component.
To position it, I used Flexbox. Added `min-height` of 100vh to the <body> to make the body display 100% of the browser screen size. Added `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to align the card vertically using the body as reference. 
Added max-width.
The Proceed to Payment, Cancel Order and Change buttons change their color when hovered.

### Useful resources

- Bootstrap documentation.
