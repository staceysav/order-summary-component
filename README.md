## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Bootstrap CSS Grid


I decided to make this challenge using Bootstrap. 
The order summary component was created with the Card component.
To position it, I used Flexbox. Added `min-height` of 100vh to the <body> to make the body display 100% of the browser screen size. Added `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to align the card vertically using the body as reference. 
Added max-width.
I don't know how to add waves in the background. The shadow doesn't look as good as in the layout. Struggles with margins.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- Bootstrap documentation.
